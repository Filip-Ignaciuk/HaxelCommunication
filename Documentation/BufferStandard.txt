The standard is roughly sorted by the most common actions.
The standard allows for objects to be sent back and forth between a client and a server.
Each class has a notion starting with Buffer, and then the person who is sending the object.
For example BufferConnect is a class reserved for the client to send an object to the server, and BufferServerConnect is the server's Response.
